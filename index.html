                <p>Hello, my name is Anibal Pablo. I am attending this class because I want to become a web developer. I work during the day, but as soon as I am back home, I study and take multiple online courses to achieve my goal. I only just started learning web development this year, my first introduction to web development was this Spring 2024 semester with HTML and CSS. I then learned JavaScript during the summer. I have taken CIN 131 and 132 at CCSF. I took an introduction to JS at SJCC this summer. As of 09/15/2024 I am officially A+ certified. I am currently studying for my Network+ certification. I am having so much fun learning everything computers and coding. A quote I really like is, “if you have enough time to fantasize about a beautiful ending, live beautifully until the end” by Hideaki Sorachi.</p>

        <section class="reason"><p>I am attending CNIT 133M-Mobile Web at CCSF to learn skills specifically for a mobile UI. My end goal is to become a web developer, but I also do have plans to use these skills to create personal websites. I am part of a unique community of people called Maya Mam. When given the chance, I would like to share bits of it online for others to read. I want to do it for the sake of teaching and learning. I am grateful for the Internet for providing me with so much free-knowledge, so I would just like to return the favor.</p></section>

            <dd>W3 Schools is an amazing resource to learn new and remember HTML, CSS, and JavaScript rules. I was first introduced to the website in CNIT 131H. We relied on the website to learn basic HTML. I rely on it often when I need to remember proper HTML syntax or CSS syntax. I would highly recommend reading through the first few HTML and CSS modules, because it will give you a proper, and brief introduction. </dd>
            <dt><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MDN Web Docs</a></dt>
            <dd>MDN Web Docs,  is another great resource. It goes much more in depth about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I also relied on the website to learn the basics of networking and how websites function. It is a great resource for people who want to learn about an aspect of web development and be provided with additional resources and topics that are relevant to the current topic.</dd>
